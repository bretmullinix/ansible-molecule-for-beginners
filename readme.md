# Working with Ansible

Last updated: 06.19.2020

## Purpose

The purpose of the repo is to provide simple tutorials for **Ansible Molecule**.
**Ansible Molecule** allows you to perform **Test Driven Development** on
**Ansible** code.  **Test Driven Development** (**TDD**) is a process
where you do the following for any new or changed code:

1.  Create a test that fails
2.  Create a test that passes with the smallest amount of code possible
3.  **refactor**: Restructure the code for various reasons.  The reason
could be maintainability, performance, etc.  
4.  Repeat steps 1-3 until the new code has been added, or the code change is
complete.

The process of failing a test, passing a test, and refactoring is better
known as **Red**, **Green**, **Refactor**.
